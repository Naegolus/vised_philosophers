C/C++ Standard Library Dependencies

When compiling C projects, use {i686,x86_64}-w64-mingw32-gcc. The resulting binary will depend on at least KERNEL32.DLL and
whatever MSVCRT.DLL is on clients' systems. Therefore, you'll need to make sure clients have the Microsoft C Runtime installed to use your software.

When compiling a C++ project, you must use {i686,x86_64}-w64-mingw32-g++ to at least link. Otherwise, you'll find you are missing LIBSTDC++-6.DLL and/or LIBGCC_S_SJLJ-1.DLL.

When shipping a C++ project, you'll need to include LIBSTDC++-6.DLL and/or LIBGCC_S_SJLJ-1.DLL with your install.
You can grab these from your Linux install where you're performing the build in the associated MinGW directory, e.g., /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/4.6/.
Note that you can have gcc include these libraries statically by including the flags, -static-libgcc and -static-libstdc++

$ autoreconf --install

=>
$ sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
$ ../configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 CFLAGS="-static-libgcc" CXXFLAGS="-static-libstdc++"

R-Pi
$ ../configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf
